# Malware detection with classifiers - Machine Learning homework
This repository contains the source code of a project that aims to analyze the results of Java implementations of Naive-Bayes and SVM classifiers over the [Drebin]{https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/dataset/feature_vectors.zip} Android malware dataset.

The main file (Homework1.java) allows to create in a random way (with or without  percentage  control of malware's incidence) a fixed number of sample subsets of the main dataset that will be trained and tested with a Naive-Bayes or  SVM classifier. All the procedures (including a debugging one based on an Evaluator class that can report the features of a sample) can be controlled by modifying the private fields of the Homework1 class.

Results of each test are automatically printed on resulting txt log files.
